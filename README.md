# **Interpolation and Fibonacci Search for Sorted Arrays**

## **Description**
The **Interpolation and Fibonacci Search for Sorted Arrays** project implements two search algorithms — **Interpolation Search** and **Fibonacci Search** — in **C++**. These algorithms are designed to search for a specific element within a sorted array. We compare both algorithms and analyze their performance under different conditions, and combine them to provide an optimized search solution.

## **Features**
- **Interpolation Search**: A search algorithm that improves on binary search by estimating the position of the target element based on the value of the element.
- **Fibonacci Search**: An algorithm that reduces the search space using Fibonacci numbers to divide the sorted array into smaller portions.
- **Comparison**: We compare the performance of both search methods in terms of time complexity and efficiency.
- **Combined Approach**: A hybrid search method that leverages the strengths of both Interpolation and Fibonacci search for optimized results.

## **Technologies Used**
- **C++**: The project is implemented using C++ for efficient computation and memory handling.
- **Standard Template Library (STL)**: Used for array management and basic operations.

## **How to Use**
1. **Clone** this repository to your local machine:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Interpolation-and-Fibonacci-Search-for-Sorted-Arrays.git
    ```
2. **Compile** the C++ code using a C++ compiler (like **g++**):
    ```bash
    g++ -o search main.cpp
    ```
3. **Run** the program and provide the input sorted array and the target element to search:
    ```bash
    ./search
    ```
4. **Output**: The program will display the index of the target element found using either Interpolation or Fibonacci Search, depending on the choice.

## **Installation**
To use this project, ensure you have the following:
